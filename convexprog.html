<center><h2>MATLAB implementation of a primal-dual interior-point solver for 
convex programs with constraints</h2>

<p>There are some very excellent software packages for solving constrained
optimization problems (such as 
<a href="http://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt">IPOPT</a>). My code is not as
efficient or as robust or as flexible as others, but it has the virtue 
of being simple (the solver is only <b>150 lines</b> long!) and 
(relatively) easy to understand and use, and still works 
pretty well. It should also be reasonably fast for optimization 
problems that aren't too demanding.</p>

<p>My MATLAB code is based on the recent work in interior-point methods,
specifically those methods that keep track of both the primal and dual
optimization variables (hence primal-dual methods). These methods
are special because they are numerically stable under a wide range
of conditions, so they should work well for many different types of 
constrained optimization problems. That being said, you can always 
find a constrained optimization problem that is difficult enough to
break these methods, so be careful! See below for a brief list of 
references that lay the foundation for this code.</p>

<p> I use a merit function which ensures global convergence (see 
the references below). What this means for you is that you don't have 
to use the Newton step (and compute the Hessian of the objective, which
might be expensive to compute) to be guaranteed to converge to the 
optimal solution. For instance, you could use a quasi-Newton approximation
to the Hessian instead, which is computed using the gradient information.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, praise, or comments, or would like to
report a bug, do not hesitate to contact <a
href="index.html">me</a>. I've tested this software in MATLAB
version 7.5.</p>

<h4>Installation and use</h4>

<p>Click <a href="convexprog.tar.gz">here</a> to download a compressed 
TAR archive containing six MATLAB files. The interior-point solver is 
<code>ipsolver.m</code>. There are also two files for a demonstration
of how to use my MATLAB function to find the solution to a convex 
quadratically-constrained quadratic program, and there are another 
three files which comprise a demonstration of logistic regression,
again using my implementation of the primal-dual interior-point 
solver. If you don't know what logistic regression is and how 
it is used for classification, and how it is connected to 
constrained, convex programming, I highly recommend reading up on it. 
See the bottom of this page for some suggested references on this topic.</p>

<p>If you type <code>help ipsolver</code> in the MATLAB console, you will see 
instructions on how to use the solver for your constrained optimization
problem. I also highly recommend running and understanding the two 
examples I provided, since they should give you a good idea how to 
use solver in your own MATLAB script.</p>
