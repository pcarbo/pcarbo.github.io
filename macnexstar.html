<h2>How to partition and format an external hard drive for Mac OS X</h2>

<p>I have an Apple PowerBook G4, and I wanted an easy and inexpensive
way to backup my data. I heard all these great things about external
hard drive enclosures and how you can buy a cheap hard drive and then
effortly hook it up to your computer using the USB port. So I
purchased a Vantec NexStar external 3.5&quot; hard drive enclosure
(which is meant to be compatible with Mac OS X) and a Samsung
Spinpoint 120 GB hard drive. That's when the frustration began.</p>

<p>To make a very long story short, Apple's own Disk Utility was
unable to initialize partitions in the Mac OS (HFS+) format, but
ironically, but worked fine with the Windows FAT32 format. All hope
was lost (and a lot of time, for that matter), until my roommate found
an article posted at <a href="http://macosxhints.com"></a>. With some
tweaking, here is the solution.</p>

<p>Let's suppose you would like to create two partitions on the new
hard drive, one in HFS+ format, and the second in FAT32 so you can
share your files with your Windows friends. Note that I am currently
running Mac OS X 10.3.9. These are approximately the steps I followed
to format my drive properly.</p>

<ol type=1>

<li>Connect the external drive and switch it on. the external
drive. If a window pops up about initializing new drive, press the
ignore button.

<li>Open up Disk Utility, click on the Partition tab and modify the
Volume Scheme to have 2 partitions. Name them whatever you want and
don't worry about their format for now.

<li>If you're like me, Disk Utility will partition the drive correctly
but fail to format the partitions. Remember the names of the
partitions. For me, the names are disk1s3 and disk1s5 for the first
and second partitions. Quit Disk Utility.

<li>Run the following command, but change NAME1 to something
 informative for you: <tt>newfs_hfs -v NAME1 /dev/rdisk1s3</tt><br>
Notice the &quot;r&quot; in front of &quot;disk1s3&quot;. When it's done, 
you have an HFS+ partition.

<li>Now, create the second partition with the command:<br>
<tt>diskutil eraseVolume MS-DOS NAME2 disk1s5</tt><br>

<li>You should now be able to mount the drives (if they aren't already) 
with the commands:<br>
<tt>diskutil mount disk1s3<br>
    diskutil mount disk1s5</tt>
</ol>

<p>You're done!</p>
