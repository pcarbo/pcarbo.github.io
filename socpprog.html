<center><h2>MATLAB implementation of a primal-dual interior-point solver for 
convex second-order cone programs</h2>

<p>This is a simple implementation of a primal-dual interior-point method for
solving an optimization problem formulated as a second-order cone program
(SOCP) in which the objective is convex. My code is not expected to be as 
robust or as fast as other software packages, but it is extremely simple to 
use and understand. And it might even work well for fairly large problems.</p>

<p>My implementation requires that you are able write a MATLAB function that
computes at any given point the value of the objective, its gradient vector, 
and the Hessian (i.e. the second-order partial derivatives). For more
information on second-order cone programs, I highly recommend reading
Convex Programming by Boyd and Vandenberghe (Cambridge University Press, 
2004), but there are many other references in the numerical optimization 
literature, and some of them may be even worth reading.</p>

<p>For further details behind the implementation, see 
<a href="convexprog.html">this webpage</a>, which describes my MATLAB code 
for solving slightly more general convex programs.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, praise, or comments, or would like to
report a bug, do not hesitate to contact <a
href="index.html">me</a>. I've tested this software in MATLAB
version 7.5.</p>

<h4>Installation and use</h4>

<p>Click <a href="socpprog.tar.gz">here</a> to download a compressed 
TAR archive containing three MATLAB files. The interior-point solver is 
<code>socpsolver.m</code>. There are also two files for a demonstration
of how to use my MATLAB function to find the solution to a group feature
selection problem for linear regression (a problem currently being 
investigated in the machine learning research field). This demonstration 
was contributed by
<a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/spider/schmidtm">Mark Schmidt</a>.

<p>If you type <code>help socpsolver</code> in the MATLAB console, 
you will see instructions on how to use the solver for your own
second-order cone optimization problem. I also highly recommend running 
and understanding the example provided, since it should give 
you a good idea how to use solver in your own MATLAB script.</p>
