(MEX files): a tutorial</h2>

<p>MATLAB is wonderful programming language for scientific research.
Unfortunately, its kind interface comes at the cost of speed. For many
of the machine learning problems I've worked on over the years,
MATLAB's slowness was so severe I had to resort to implementing my 
algorithms with lower level languages such as C++. Implementing a 
numerical algorithm in C++ usually involves much more coding and 
painful debugging. Not fun.</p>

<p>The pain is eased knowing that it is possible to interface my C++
implementations back to MATLAB. By creating a MATLAB interface in my
code, then compiling my code into a <b>MEX file</b>, my obtuse code
becomes both fast <em>and</em> easy to use, and as a result I can run
my experiments and plot the results using MATLAB's nice plotting
tools. Different people may have different reasons for resorting to
MEX files, but it is an important tool for almost any seasoned MATLAB
user.</p>

<p>What's the catch? Creating a MEX file can be a harrowing
experience. The purpose of this tutorial is to educate you in hopes
that you will avoid the pitfalls I have encountered.  Here we go.</p>

<h4>Compiling and linking made difficult</h4>

<p>Let's suppose we wanted to create an efficient MATLAB routine that
calculates the height of the Normal probability density function (pdf)
at a given point on the line. That there are at least five gazillion
MATLAB implementations that already calculate this quantity is beside
the point. (Normally, when you decide to write a MATLAB routine in
C++, you should make sure it is worth your while!)</p>

<p>Before we embark on the actual C++ coding, we need to examine how
MATLAB creates a MEX File. The exact procedure is system-dependent, so
what I describe here may differ slightly from your setup. At school I
have access to a machine installed with the Linux operating system,
and I have my own Apple computer with Mac OS X. Both these operating
systems are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">Unix-like</a>,
hence their differences will be rather cosmetic.</p>

<p>In order to build MEX files, we need to make sure that we have the
proper compiler installed on our system. On my Linux machine, I'm
using MATLAB 7.3 (R2006b), and according to <a
href="http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1600/1601.html">MathWorks
product support</a> it was built with the <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org">GNU Compiler Collection</a> (GCC)
3.4.5. Unfortunately, I did not have this particular version of the
compiler installed on my system. Different versions of the same
compiler are effectively different compilers, as they follow different
conventions. You should never link libraries or object code unless
they are compiled in the same way. I downloaded the GCC source from my
local university FTP mirror and built the entire package on my
system. GCC includes compilers for many different languages, and they
can be found in the <code><nobr>bin</nobr></code> subdirectory of the GCC software
installation. MATLAB uses three of them: the C compiler
<code><nobr>gcc</nobr></code>, the C++ compiler <code><nobr>g++</nobr></code>, and the Fortran
77 compiler <code><nobr>g77</nobr></code>. When installing GCC, it is a bad idea to
blindly follow the default installation as it may overwrite the
existing compilers. You should install it in a new
directory. Afterward, to make things simpler, I created a <b>symbolic
link</b> to each of the compilers like so:

<p><code><nobr><pre>  cd /usr/bin
  ln -s gcc-install-path/bin/gcc gcc-3.4.5</pre></nobr></code></p>

Then I did the same thing for the other two compilers. Since
<code><nobr>/usr/bin</nobr></code> is in the <b>path</b> (see the environment
variable <code><nobr>PATH</nobr></code>), I can call the program anywhere I am
simply by typing <code><nobr>gcc-3.4.5</nobr></code>. By including the version
number in the symbolic link, I avoid calling version 3.4.5 of
<code><nobr>gcc</nobr></code> unless I really want to.

<p>I was much more fortunate on my Apple computer because I already
had the correct version of GCC installed; both Mac OS X 10.3.9
(Panther) and MATLAB 7.2 (R2006a) have been built with the GNU
compiler collection 3.3.<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Now that we've installed the compiler collection that agrees with
MATLAB, let's examine the <a href="normpdf.cpp">C++ code</a> I've
written to compute the Normal pdf. After we've built the MEX file,
typing <code><nobr>disp(normpdf(1/2,0,1))</nobr></code> in the MATLAB prompt should
display the response of the Normal pdf with zero mean and unit
variance at point 0.5, which is approximately 0.3521.<sup><a
href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> The first four lines of code in the
function <code><nobr>mexFunction</nobr></code>

<p><code><nobr><pre>  if (nrhs != numInputArgs)
      mexErrMsgTxt("Incorrect number of input arguments");
  if (nlhs != numOutputArgs)
      mexErrMsgTxt("Incorrect number of output arguments");</pre>
</nobr></code></p>

<p>check to make sure the user has entered the correct number of input
and output arguments when calling the function in MATLAB. After that,
the lines</p>

<p><code><nobr><pre>  double x  = getMatlabScalar(prhs[0]);
  double mu = getMatlabScalar(prhs[1]);
  double v  = getMatlabScalar(prhs[2]);</pre></nobr></code></p>

<p>retrieve the point along the line, mean and variance using our
function <code><nobr>getMatlabScalar</nobr></code>. In order to understand exactly
how this code retrieves the values of the inputs, you may want to take
a look at the <a
href="http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/helpdesk.html">MATLAB
documentation</a> on &quot;external interfaces.&quot; Next, the line</p>

<p><code><nobr><pre>  double& p = createMatlabScalar(plhs[0]);</pre></nobr></code></p>

<p>reserves a place for the output of our function and <code><nobr>p</nobr></code>
is a variable that refers to it. And finally, the line</p>

<p><code><nobr><pre>  p = exp(-(x-mu)*(x-mu)/(2*v)) / sqrt(2*pi*v);</pre></nobr></code></p>

<p>uses a couple functions from the standard C math library to compute
the pdf response, then stores this value in the location reserved for
the single output argument. Now that we have a basic understanding of the C++
code, let's go ahead and build the MEX file so we can see if
<code><nobr>normpdf</nobr></code> behaves the way it is supposed to.</p>

<p>First, download the code and make sure you are running MATLAB in
the same directory as the location of the file
<code><nobr>normpdf.cpp</nobr></code> (type <code><nobr>pwd</nobr></code> in the MATLAB prompt
to check this). If you haven't done so already, you should set up MEX
by typing <code><nobr>mex -setup</nobr></code> in the MATLAB prompt. I chose option
2, but in my experience it makes little difference which option I
select. To create the MEX file on my Linux machine, I type the
following either in the MATLAB prompt or in the UNIX command line:</p>

<p><code><nobr><pre>  mex CXX=g++-3.4.5 CXX=g++-3.4.5 LD=g++-3.4.5
      -lm -output normpdf normpdf.cpp</pre></nobr></code></p>

<p>It produces a MEX file called <code><nobr>normpdf.mexglx</nobr></code>. On my
Apple computer, I type</p>

<p><code><nobr><pre>  mex CC=g++ CXX=g++ LD=g++ -lm
      -output normpdf normpdf.cpp</pre></nobr></code></p>

<p>to create a MEX file with the name
<code><nobr>normpdf.mexmac</nobr></code>.<sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup>
There's a few things worth explaining here. (It might be helpful to
look at the external interfaces documentation and the command line
help, <code><nobr>mex -help</nobr></code>, while you're reading this.) First, what
I've done is set the C and C++ compiler variables so that they will
call the right version of the compiler. The variable <code><nobr>LD</nobr></code>
overrides the choice of linker. Notice that the C++ compiler and
linker will always be used. This is because I want to make sure that
we use the C++ linker.<sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> The first
three options override MATLAB's default choices for the compiler. The
default settings can be found in the MEX options file which is created
when running <code><nobr>mex -setup</nobr></code>. On my Linux machine, this file
is <code><nobr>~/.matlab/R2006b/mexopts.sh</nobr></code>. The flag <code><nobr>-lm</nobr></code>
links the MEX file to the C math library. While MATLAB tends to do
link to this library by default, we include this option just to be
safe. Once the MEX file is created, you can call it like any other
function in MATLAB.

<p>Including the <code><nobr>-v</nobr></code> flag when calling <code><nobr>mex</nobr></code>
allows us to peer under the hood. What you should observe is that
<code><nobr>gcc</nobr></code> is called once and <code><nobr>g++</nobr></code> is called
twice. The first call to <code><nobr>g++</nobr></code> compiles the source file
<code><nobr>normpdf.cpp</nobr></code> into object code. Next, <code><nobr>gcc</nobr></code>
compiles a C source file written by the MATLAB developers. And
finally, <code><nobr>gcc</nobr></code> is called to link together the object code
and libraries in order to build the MEX File.</p>

<p>After a long look under the hood, we see that it wouldn't be all
that difficult to duplicate these steps ourselves by calling the
compilers with the appropriate flags. In other words, we could
reverse-engineer the <code><nobr>mex</nobr></code> program. But that would be
silly! The whole purpose of <code><nobr>mex</nobr></code> is to hide the
complicated details from us. Nonetheless, it will be a useful exercise
to compile the object files ourselves since we will need to know how
to do this when we compile and link to a library.</p>

<p>I cannot help but use a Makefile, a script which automates the
compilation process very elegantly. If you have never used <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make">GNU make</a> before, I suggest
you read a <a
href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/orgs/acm/tutorials/dev-in-unix/makefiles.html">tutorial</a>. On
my Linux machine, I wrote the following bare bones Makefile using a
text editor and saved it in the same directory as the C++ source
file:</p>

<p><code><nobr><pre>  MEXSUFFIX  = mexglx
  MATLABHOME = /cs/local/generic/lib/pkg/matlab-7.3
  MEX        = mex
  CXX        = g++-3.4.5
  CFLAGS     = -fPIC -ansi -pthread -DMX_COMPAT_32 \
               -DMATLAB_MEX_FILE

  LIBS      = -lm
  INCLUDE   = -I$(MATLABHOME)/extern/include
  MEXFLAGS  = -cxx CC='$(CXX)' CXX='$(CXX)' LD='$(CXX)'

  normpdf.$(MEXSUFFIX): normpdf.o
	  $(MEX) $(MEXFLAGS) $(LIBS) -output normpdf $^

  normpdf.o: normpdf.cpp
	  $(CXX) $(CFLAGS) $(INCLUDE) -c $^</pre></nobr></code></p>

<p>Simply typing <code><nobr>make</nobr></code> in the same directory as the
Makefile as the C++ source file compiles and builds the MEX file in
two steps.<sup><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup> In the first step, the
<code><nobr>g++</nobr></code> compiler specified by the <code><nobr>CXX</nobr></code> variable
compiles (but does not link, as indicated by the <code><nobr>-c</nobr></code> flag)
the source file into object code <code><nobr>normpdf.o</nobr></code>. Some special
options are specified according to the <code><nobr>CFLAGS</nobr></code>
variable. It is not really a mystery how I chose these. I simply
peered under the hood, and copied the options displayed on the screen
by running <code><nobr>mex</nobr></code> as I did above, but with the
<code><nobr>-v</nobr></code> flag.  The first flag tells the compiler to generate
position-independent code, which I suspect is necessary because MATLAB
loads the program dynamically. The <code><nobr>-ansi</nobr></code> flag ensures
that the C++ code strictly satisfies the ISO standard, and
<code><nobr>-pthread</nobr></code> adds support for
multi-threaded processes. The last two options in <code><nobr>CFLAGS</nobr></code>
define preprocessor macros which aren't of import here. Notice that it
is also important to tell the compiler where to find the
<code><nobr>mex.h</nobr></code> header file. This information is provided by the
<code><nobr>INCLUDE</nobr></code> Makefile variable.</p>

<p>In the second step, <code><nobr>mex</nobr></code> link the object code together
with the libraries and its own source files to produce the final MEX
file. </p>

<p>This Makefile will also work on my Apple computer if I make some
changes to the first five lines:</p>

<p><code><nobr><pre>  MEXSUFFIX  = mexmac
  MATLABHOME = /Applications/MATLAB72
  MEX        = mex
  CXX        = g++
  CFLAGS     = -fno-common -no-cpp-precomp -fexceptions</pre>
</nobr></code></p>

<p> Again, the flags used to compile the C++ come from observing the
behaviour of <code><nobr>mex</nobr></code> on my Apple computer.</p>

<p>As you can see, we went through great pains to build a small MEX
file. We probably made things more difficult than necessary, but this
procedure should translate to much larger projects as well. In fact,
we'll see that linking our project to a library is now relatively
straightforward.</p>

<h4>Linking with a C library</h4>

<p>We're now going to act a little smarter and reuse an existing
function from the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl">GNU
Scientific Library</a> that computes the Normal pdf. (I downloaded GSL
version 1.8.) In order to to use GSL's functions in MATLAB, we will
have to skirt the normal build procedure and configure the install
script to suit our own needs.</p>

<p>The first step when installing GSL (and many other libraries) is to
run the &quot;configure&quot; script. On my Linux machine, I ran the
configure script with the following options:</p>

<p><code><nobr><pre>  configure --disable-shared --prefix=gsl-install-path 
    CC=gcc-3.4.5 CFLAGS='-O2 -fPIC -ansi -pthread'</pre></nobr></code></p>

<p>The configuration comes straight from our previous experiences: we
need to compile the library with the options used by
<code><nobr>mex</nobr></code>. I removed some of the flags I figured would have no
impact on compiling GSL, and then added the <code><nobr>-O2</nobr></code> flag to
request optimized code. It can be difficult to keep track of shared
libraries and their whereabouts, especially when compiling with
different versions of GCC, so I disabled them with
<code><nobr>--disable-shared</nobr></code>. Static libraries are certainly less
efficient, but the keep-it-simple-stupid principle takes priority
here. On my Apple, I ran the configure script with the following
settings:</p>

<p><code><nobr><pre>  configure --disable-shared --prefix=gsl-install-path 
    CC=gcc CFLAGS='-O2 -fno-common -no-cpp-precomp -fexceptions'</pre>
</nobr></code></p>

<p>I then put the static libraries <code><nobr>libgsl.a</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>libgslcblas.a</nobr></code> in the <code><nobr>lib</nobr></code> subdirectory of my
home directory.</p>

<p>My new version of the C++ source code that uses the GSL routine
<code><nobr>gsl_ran_gaussian_pdf</nobr></code> can be found <a
href="normpdfgsl.cpp">here</a>. In order to build the new MEX file, I
renamed the source file to <code><nobr>normpdf.cpp</nobr></code>) and made a couple
changes to the Makefile:</p>

<p><code><nobr><pre>  LIBS = -L$(HOME)/lib/gcc-3.4.5 -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm
  INCLUDE = -I$(HOME)/include -I$(MATLABHOME)/extern/include</pre>
</nobr></code></p> 

<p>I put all the GSL include files in the <code><nobr>include</nobr></code>
subdirectory of my home directory. With these
modifications, I was able to successfully create the new MEX file and
call it from MATLAB. Note that I made analogous small modifications to
the Makefile on my Apple.</p>

<h4>Parting notes</h4>

<p>The motivation behind this tutorial may have been lacking because
we didn't delve into very realistic scenarios; in reality, my projects
can be much larger and much more complicated and I inevitably link to
many different libraries, whic may even ve written in different
languages such as Fortran. Nonetheless, my words should be taken as a
gentle guideline for future projects.</p>
